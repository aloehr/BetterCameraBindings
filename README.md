# Better Camera Bindings
With this plugin you can create your own camera bindings.

### **Features**
- Create bindings that only use normal or alt camera.
- Bind to your L2/R2 "buttons"
- Bind to a stick direction
- Reversed nadeo default camera behaviour
  (if you switch from a different camera it starts in alt camera mode)
- Bindings can be triggered when pressing, releasing OR holding the button.

Don't forget to unbind the buttons you want to use in the nadeo settings.

For feedback / suggestions / issues write an issue on github or dm me @hydrophob on discord / twitch.
Since I was only able to test the plugin with Keyboard, XBox One Controller and PS4 Controller,
it would be goot to know if there are issues with other devices.

**Known Issue:** If you switch into cam7 you can't switch back with these bindings. You have to use a nadeo camera binding to get out of cam7.
